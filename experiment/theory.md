### Central Limit Theorem Statement
The central limit theorem states that whenever a random sample of size n is taken from any distribution with mean and variance, then the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with mean and variance. The larger the value of the sample size, the better the approximation to the normal.
### Assumptions of Central Limit Theorem
* The sample should be drawn randomly following the condition of randomization.
* The samples drawn should be independent of each other. They should not influence the other samples.
* When the sampling is done without replacement, the sample size shouldnâ€™t exceed 10% of the total population.
* The sample size should be sufficiently large.

### Formula
The formula for the central limit theorem is given below:

$$Z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
