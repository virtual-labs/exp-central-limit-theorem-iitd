##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:

###### Step 1: Select the Distribution
In the simulation step, choose the type of distribution of the random variable, which can be either Discrete or Continuous.

###### Step 2: Set Parameters
Set all the parameters according to the selected distribution, ensuring that the distribution is appropriately defined.

###### Step 3: Set Sample Size
Specify the number of random variables or set the size of the sample chosen for the experiment. This determines the number of observations that will be taken from the chosen distribution.

###### Step 4: Click the 'Go' Button
Initiate the experiment by clicking the 'Go' button. This will trigger the experiment to generate random samples from the specified distribution based on the parameters and sample size you've set.

###### Step 5: View the Graphical Representation
After clicking 'Go', observe the graphical representation of the Central Limit Theorem. This graph illustrates how the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, irrespective of the underlying distribution of the population.
