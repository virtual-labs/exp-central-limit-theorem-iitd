##### In order to perform the experiment, one need to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, Select the distribution of the random variable (Discrete or Continuous) for the distribution plot.
###### Step 2:  Set all the parameters according to the selected distribution.
###### Step 3:  Set the number of random variables or set the size of the sample choosen for the experiment.
###### Step 4:  Click the 'Go' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 6:  Hence, the graphical representation of the central limit theorem can be viewed.
